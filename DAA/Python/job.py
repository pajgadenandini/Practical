# Summary of Complexities:
# Scenario	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
# Best Case	
# ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)
# O(n)
# Worst Case	
# ùëÇ(ùëõ2)
# O(n)
# Average Case	
# ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)
# O(n)
# Discussion on Complexities:
# Time Complexity:

# Worst-case time complexity is 
# ùëÇ(ùëõ^2) because, in the worst case, for each job, we may have to check all available slots (up to 
# ùëõ
# n slots).
# However, best-case and average-case time complexities are also 
# ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)because of the sorting step and the slot-checking step for each job.
# Even though we might find slots more efficiently in some cases, we can't escape the fact that, in general, we need to check multiple time slots for each job, which results in 
# ùëÇ(ùëõ^2) behavior.
# Space Complexity:

# Space complexity is
# O(n) as we store:
# The list of jobs,
# The list of time slots (which is at most 
# n long),
# The result (the scheduled jobs and total profit).
# This is relatively efficient because we only store the necessary data for scheduling and results. We don‚Äôt need extra data structures beyond the job list and time slots.
